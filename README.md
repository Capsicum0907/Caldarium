# Caldarium

Forge Energy: something that makes it, something that keeps it.

*Caldarium* is the hot room of a Roman bath — the one the fire under the
floor keeps warm.

> **Status: scaffold only.** The mod loads and does nothing.

## Target

| | |
|---|---|
| Minecraft | 1.21.1 |
| Loader | NeoForge 21.1.248 |
| Java | 21 |

1.21.1 is the version large tech mods stayed on, so it is where this mod is useful.

## Design

A generator that turns fuel into Forge Energy, and a battery that keeps it.

They ship together because a battery on its own has nothing to fill it. Everything
else in this set is one thing; this is one thing that happens to need two blocks to
be a thing at all.

**No network.** Energy is not routed, planned or cabled. Each block, on its tick,
offers what it has to the six blocks touching it, and that is the entire transport
layer. A network would be a second system to keep correct, and the mods this is
meant to sit beside already have one.

The energy interface is NeoForge's own, so anything that already speaks Forge
Energy — from any mod — connects without either side knowing about the other.

Capacity, transfer rates and generation rate are settings. There is no defensible
number to write into the code here: what is right depends entirely on what else is
installed.

## Build

```
run.bat                   # compile and launch a dev client - double-clickable
gradlew build             # produce the jar
gradlew runGameTestServer # run every game test, headless, then exit
gradlew runData           # regenerate models, recipes and language
```

`JAVA_HOME` must point at a JDK 21, or `java` must be on `PATH`.

## Roadmap

- [x] **0** — scaffold; the mod loads
- [ ] **1** — the feature above, in a form that can be watched
- [ ] **2** — checked by game tests rather than by eye
